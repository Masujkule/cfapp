ActionController::UnknownFormat (StaticPagesController#about is missing a template for this request format and variant.

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not… nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

It was first designed in 2010, in response to Kolohe Andino and Julian Wilson’s requests for a “stiffer tail, that pushes back with more drive”. Julian netted some of his early career wins on board a Driver, and to this day, the Driver continues to be Kolohe’s go-to board for surf between 3’-6’. Carissa Moore rode Drivers predominately to both her second and third World Titles, and Tyler Wright rode Drivers exclusively during her 2016 World Title campaign. The Driver has morphed and evolved continually over the years, but the basic concept remains the same. Designed around a low tail rocker, balanced with a more generous nose rocker, it’s meant to be ridden “off the tail”. Because of its built in drive and the fact it easily projects under tail pressure, the Driver is an easy choice for average ability surfers who stand heavy and rely on the rear foot for drive."], ["color", ""], ["updated_at", 2017-10-03 00:40:01 UTC], ["id", 60]]
